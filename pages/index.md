  If you're reading this, you've likely already seen my portfolio page available
  at [galaxial.github.io](galaxial.github.io), and are looking for how to get
  started in creating your own. This guide will walk you through the steps to
  getting your template deployed so that you can unleash your creativity and
  make it yours. 


  For this tutorial, you will need:


  * A github account

  * A Netlify Identity account


  (If you don't have either of these yet, head over to [github.com](github.com),
  and [netlify.com](netlify.com) respectively to make your account, and meet
  back here when you're ready)


  Now, let's get started, shall we?
---
The first thing you'll want to do is find yourself a template, there are many available to choose one, so try to find one that best resembles your vision for your site. 

For this tutorial I'll be using the Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate, if you would like to follow along yourself you can also start with it by accessing it at <https://templates.netlify.com/template/jekyll-with-netlify-cms-boilerplate/>

Once You've found your template, you should be able to see a button marked 'Deploy to Netlify'

This button will bring you to a page prompting you to connect your github account to your netlify identity. Click it, and it will prompt you to login and connect.

Now that you're connected, this is where you're able to start making it yours. The next screen will prompt you to enter a repository name and to save & deploy. The repository name you choose here will be the name of the repository created in your github account, as well as part of the url that will be used to access your new portfolio, so choose wisely!

Once you have something you're happy with, go ahead and

Once you've hit deploy, you should see something like this:

![Site Loading Screenshot](/assets/img/uploads/deploy_complete-s4.png "Site Loading")

It will tell you that the site is currently deploying. This will take a few moments. In the meantime, you'll be receiving an email from your netlify account informing you that you've received an invite to a site. This will initially look like a random string of characters, but don't worry, we'll be changing that shortly. 



After you've accepted the invite and the site has finished deploying, click on 'Site Settings' to make some changes.

Next you'll want to click 'Change Site Name', enter your new name, and save. 

Congratulations! Your template can now be reached at your_site_name.netlify.com!

But we're not done yet here. 

You're likely wanting to have a more prestigious namespace than Netflix, and any techie around knows the name github, so next we'll move on to publishing your page through github pages, and get into how to make changes to your site. 

Now you'll want to head back over to your github account. You may have noticed a new entry in your repositories, with the name that we entered just a few steps back. Open it up and take a look inside.
