  If you're reading this, you've likely already seen my portfolio page
  available 


  , and are looking for how to get started in creating your own. This guide will
  walk you through the steps to getting your template deployed so that you can
  unleash your creativity and make it yours. 


  For this tutorial, you will need:


  * A github account

  * A Netlify Identity account


  (If you don't have either of these yet, head over to github.com, and
  netlify.com respectively to make your account, and meet back here when you're
  ready)


  Now, let's get started, shall we?
