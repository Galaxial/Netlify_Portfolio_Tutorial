  If you're reading this, you've likely already seen my portfolio page available
  at [galaxial.github.io](galaxial.github.io), and are looking for how to get
  started in creating your own. This guide will walk you through the steps to
  getting your template deployed so that you can unleash your creativity and
  make it yours. 


  For this tutorial, you will need:


  * A github account

  * A Netlify Identity account


  (If you don't have either of these yet, head over to [github.com](github.com),

  back here when you're ready)
